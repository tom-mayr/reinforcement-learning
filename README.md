# reinforcement-learning

A project for the 2023/24 Reinforcement Learning course at the Master Degree in Data Science for Economics.

In the project a reinforcement learning agent is trained to play a game of managing a farm, trying to make optimal investments. For the full description see project proposal 2 in https://github.com/afflint/rlcoding/blob/main/2023-24/projects/rl-projects.pdf.

Two solutions are proposed: tabular Q-learning and neural network deep Q-learning.

Main analysis is in the final_analysis.ipynb file. mdp.py implements the enviornment and Q.py implements the tabular Q-learning approach. The code for the deep Q-learning network is in the notebook file.
